Exemples flous :

    I had good experiences with Air Paradis before, but things seem different now, and some services feel lacking.

    Air Paradis used to be great, but lately, their service quality appears to have declined.

    I liked Air Paradis at first, but now Iâ€™m not so sure about their services anymore.

    There were times I appreciated Air Paradis, though recently their service hasn't been what I expected.

    Air Paradis has changed over time, and some of their simpler offerings seem to fall short these days.
